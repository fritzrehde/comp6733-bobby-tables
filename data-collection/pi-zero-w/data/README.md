See PDF of experimental setup [here](./test-env-diagram.pdf).

- Devices:
    - x ,y ,h measurements in meters; h means distance to floor
    - 3 Raspberry Pi Zero W as basestations:
        - PiHotspot1: x=0.5, y=2.0, h=0.5
        - PiHotspot2: x=3.0, y=2.5, h=0.5
        - PiHotspot3: x=3.0, y=0.5, h=0.5
    - Laptop (Thinkpad T470p) as tracked device, which measure RSSI values from base stations: h=1.0
